Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

(Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principle ,methods and tools to the development and maintenance  of high quality software system.)




What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):


Software engineering by far differes from normal or traditional programming because diverse criterials or measures are put into consideration during product life cycle. eg, in times of Scope, traditional programming focuses more on just writting the code to achieve  specific task or solve problem but software engineering  encompasses such process .they go as far as gatering requirement(survey),design to impliment,testing  deployment and maintainance.

software engineering use formal methodologies and best practice to ensure quality ,readability and maintainability of software. these methodologies may include waterfall,Agile,Scrum, etc. but traditional programming may not .

Quality Assurance :traditional programming may require limited testing and debugging  but software development requires rigorouse testing ,debugging and quality assurance.





Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:


1)the first step of software Development life cycle is gathering and analyzing of requirements by stakeholders.

2)Design: after requirements are been meet, the design phase comes in . and this is involves creating  of architecture for the software.

3)Implimentation: this referes to the coding .the software engineer writes code following code standards , proper programming language and adhear to best practice.

4)Testing:this is the evaluation stage of the software to ensure it meets the requirements.

5)Deployment:after testing  and approved, installation of the software to users machine or production environment for useage .

6)Maintenance:after deployment ,the software enters a phase where it is been monitored,modified and updated to address bugs and improve it.

Water Fall: waterfall involves sequential approach,predictability,less flexibility, suitable for well understood project.

Agile :agile requires customer collaboration,adaptability,continious testing and integration






Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

key difference,

Flexibility: 
waterfall is less flexible to change if project is been deployed.
agile is very flexible and adaptable

Delivery:
waterfall final product  is delivered at end of product timeline.
agile delivey is not same.

Risk Management:
in water fall,risk are identified and address at the begining of the project.

in Agile,the risk are mitigated through feedbacks,incrimental development .



in scenario like where projects requirements are defined,cleared,stable and may not change waterfall can be suitable

in times of high adaptative requirementspid time to market,startups or small teams , Agile could be put into consideration.






What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:


Requirement engineering :
is a professional responsible for analyzing, eliciting,documenting,validating and managing,the requirements of software project

process of Requirement Engineering:
1)Elicitation: gathering requirements.
2)Analysis:analyzing and understanding the collected requirements to identify conflicts and inconsistency.
3)Documentation:using variouse techniques like case,user story for proper understanding
4)Validation:validating requirements to make sure it meets the standards of stake holders.
5)Management:managing changes to require throughout project life cycle.
6)communication:translating business needs into technical requirements.

IMPORTANCE:
1)understanding stake holders needs
2)cost and time saving 
3)minimizing risk
4)Quality Assurance
5)Customer satisfaction
6)Alignment with business goal
7)Adaptative to change


principles:
1)Seperation of concern
2)Design pattern
3)ncapasulation
4)solid principles 





Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:


modularity in software design is the practice of breaking down a complex system imto a smaller,manageable modules.

the concept of modularity in software design  involves ,
isolation of change 
cleare code structure
independent testing 
reuseability
scability

Testin in software engineering is:
 an important process to ensure that the software meets its requirements ,functions properly and is free from defects.





Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:


unit testing:
this is a fundamental aspect of software development where individual units or components of a software application are tested  in issolation to ensure it functions as espected.

Integration Testing:
this involves where individual softweare modules are combined and tested as group


System testing:

this is a critical phase in software testin process where the the entire integrated system is evaluated against the specific requirements.

acceptance testing:
this is the final phase of software testing process and it involves verifying that the software meets the acceptance criterial set by stake-holders or end-uers




What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:



version controle system are tools used in software development to manage changes to source codeand other files.

IMPORTANCE:
1)They help in history and tracking changes 
2)its use for collaboratiob and conccurrent development 
3)code quality and review 
4)It helpes for backup and recovery.

Examples:

Git:
get is a popular high version control system .  with the below features:
1)data integrity
2)support of large project
3)fast performance 
4)distributed version control

Github:
git hub is a popular platform built around git version controle system.
its features are,
1)repository hosting
2)collaboration tools 
3)pull request 
4)code review

Software Project Management:this involves  the overseeing the planning,execusion and delivery of software  project within specific period of time ,budget, and quality.





Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:


the software project manager playes crutial role in software development .the role is multifaceted and involves leading,managing ,coordinating various aspect of software development project.

Challenges Faced In Managing Software Project:
1)Changing requirements
2)Tight Deadline
3)Technical debt





Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:


Software Maintenance referes to the process of modifying ,updating and enhancing software after it has been delivered and deployed .

Types Of Software Maintennce 
1)Corrective maintenance:this involves correcting defects or bugs found during operation or testing.
2)Adaptative Maintainance :
this deal with adapting the software to accomodate changes  in the environment 
3)Perfective maintainance :this deals with enhancing the software to functionality to meet evolving user needs or expectations.
4)Preventive maintenance:this deals with addressing vulnerability in the software to prevent future problem.
5)Emergency maintenance :this deals with addressing urgent issues that requires immediate attention.
